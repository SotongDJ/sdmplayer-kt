Installation [Under Construction]
-------------------------------------

Requirement:
* Kindle Touch Jailbreak
* Kindle Touch GUI Launcher
* Python for Kindle
* 

History [Under Construction]
-------------------------------------

The source code of sdmplayer-kt was come from three part:
* [Mplayer For Kindle 0.2.0] (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=119851)
* [SotongDJ's Mplayer Playback Script Set] (https://github.com/SotongDJ/launchpad-kindle)
* [K5 MPlayer for Kindle 4 Touch ] (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=170213)

After I get my kindle Keyboard, I found that the music playback function is too incomplete.
Although I install Mplayer For Kindle 0.2.0, I still can not select what I want to listen.
This is why I use my own python scripts + Mplayer (and control.sh from Mplayer For Kindle 0.2.0) + Notepad (7 Dragon) to create "SotongDJ's Mplayer Playback Script Set".
In my opinion, "SotongDJ's Mplayer Playback Script Set" is the first music player which can select the music and generate playlist immediately.

When my sister lend me her Kindle Touch, I try to use the music playback func. 
I was disappointed once again.
When I look back to my launchpad-kindle repo, it was messy as I mix a lot of thing inside.
This is why I create a new repo, for new device, for new method (Launcher).
